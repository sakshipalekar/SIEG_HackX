# About the Project
## MOTIVATION

Conventional approach to learn new things would be to follow some online tutorials,  some books or learning through courses. But it has come to notice that interactive learning and applying the knowledge and the skills gained in real world has the best impact.
Just learning the courses wont be of much help if nothing is built out of that knowledge gained.
Learning by asking doubts, solving errors and building together has proven to be effective.
The learners face an issue of not being able to have a guided path to be followed in a systematic and organised way so that they learn the most out of the course curriculum.
Learners also face and issue of “What to do next?” after completing their courses or learning something new.
Its also said that learning from others mistakes is one of the best ways to learn so that you don’t make the same mistakes. So is there a way that could be achieved?

## OBJECTIVE

The purpose of our project EDUCARE is to provide a one-stop guide to learn any trending technology or subject from scratch and not just stop at the learning stage but implementing and applying it in real-world and taking a step forward by converting the knowledge gained into a full time career by taking up internships, jobs or freelancing.
We also believe in the power of networking and building a strong community of learners to strengthen our education system
